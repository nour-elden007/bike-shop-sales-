Bike Sales Analysis Using Excel

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of bike sales data to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for growth. Using Excel, I performed data cleaning and organization to ensure accuracy and consistency. Key features of the analysis included:

1. Data Visualization: Created dynamic charts and graphs to illustrate sales trends over time.
3. Comparative Analysis: Compared sales data across different regions and time periods to identify high-performing areas and potential markets for expansion.
